Welcome to the Parallel Computing in Python repository! This project contains educational resources, examples, and code demonstrating various parallel computing techniques using Python. The repository is structured into chapters, each focusing on specific concepts and methodologies.

# Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

# Basics
Contains introductory examples and foundational concepts for understanding parallel computing.

# Chapters
1. **Chapter 2**: Threads and Synchronization
   - `thread_definition.py`: Basics of defining threads.
   - `thread_name_and_processes.py`: Understanding thread names and processes.
   - `SynchronizationPrimitive.py`: Using synchronization primitives like locks.
   - `Barrier.py`: Synchronization with barriers.
   - ... (and more).

2. **Chapter 3**: Advanced Threading
   - Focuses on advanced threading techniques and scenarios.

3. **Chapter 4**: Process-Based Parallelism
   - Examples of process creation and inter-process communication (IPC).

4. **Chapter 5**: Distributed Computing
   - MPI (Message Passing Interface) examples and other distributed systems concepts.

# Getting Started

 # Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for managing Python packages

# Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallel_computing.git
   cd parallel_computing
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create this file if needed
   ```


Navigate to the desired chapter and run the scripts:
```bash
cd chap2
python thread_definition.py
```
